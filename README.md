<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SimpliFly as envisioned will get flights between two destinations on a particular day and give a brief preview of the current weather in those two locations.  It exists as a project for teaching async that could become more.

![Original XD mockup of interface](https://github.com/ctrachte/SimpliFly/blob/README/assets/images/interface.png?raw=true)

SimpliFly is powered by [Skyscanner](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) and [Weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/)

### Dependencies

We have a few dependencies currently:
* [Boot Strap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Popper](https://popper.js.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
**If you do not plan to contribute your changes and just want to play around or view this project:**
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctrachte/SimpliFly
```
2. open `index.html` in your browser of choice

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is a full web application, so in general: open `index.html`,  and follow the contextual cues.

Full reactive bootstrap is implemented, but not yet optimized for smaller screens.  Best experience is at full width.
