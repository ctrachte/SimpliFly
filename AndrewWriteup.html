                We started <strong>SimpliFly</strong> for the purpose of learning a bit more about asynchronous code and how to implement it.  
                The bulk of what I dealt with through the project I feel was equally useful, the application of design techniques using the mediums of html, css, and the framework of bootstrap.

                During the project I oversaw much of the syling of SimpliFly, and utilized as much of <strong>Bootstrap 4.0</strong> as I could.  Where we couldn't either Caleb or I wrote some custom CSS.  
                I learned a lot about the framework and how to implement it, and a lot about how to look up things I didn't know.

                The things I didn't cover that I wanted to was fine tuning the responsiveness of the site, and replacing the weather icons that don't really fit with the look of the site with something more custom.  Perhaps in the future.

                Overall, I think it turned into an exellent product.  The only limitations we felt we couldn't pass easily were the boundaries of the SkyScanner API.  These bounds likely in place to keep us from making a competitor.
